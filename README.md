# Voltcraft Studio

A GUI application built with PyQt6 to open and display oscilloscope channel data files.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Note:** For optimal performance with large datasets (millions of points), the application uses OpenGL GPU acceleration. If you experience issues, OpenGL will be automatically disabled and fallback to CPU rendering.

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

The application will start maximized for optimal data visualization. Click the folder icon in the toolbar to browse and select a data file to display.

## Features

- Clean and modern interface with custom icon
- Compact toolbar with intuitive controls
- **Tabbed interface** for optimal workflow
  - **Waveform tab** - Full-screen graph for maximum visualization space
  - **Channel Info tab** - Clean, dark-mode metadata table
- **Interactive time series graph** - visualize voltage data across all channels
  - **Accurate time axis** - displays actual time values (Âµs, ms, s) from metadata, not just sample indices
  - **Full screen graph** - 100% of available space dedicated to waveform when viewing
  - Displays ALL data points (even 10M+ samples) with intelligent downsampling
  - Zoom with mouse wheel to see fine details
  - Pan by dragging to browse through data
  - **Dynamic Level-of-Detail** - automatically downsamples when zoomed out, shows actual data when zoomed in
  - OpenGL GPU acceleration for smooth rendering
  - Auto-scaling and legend
  - Handles millions of data points smoothly
- **Background file loading with progress dialog** - handles large files (millions of rows) smoothly
- Non-blocking UI - application stays responsive during file loading
- Parses oscilloscope channel metadata (1-4 channels)
- Displays channel information in a structured table format
- Supports multiple channels (CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4)
- Shows parameters: Frequency, Period, PK-PK, Average, Vertical pos, Probe attenuation, etc.
- Resizable split view between metadata table and graph
- Error handling for file operations
- Cancellable file loading
